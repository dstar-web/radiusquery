# radiusquery

The code implements a radius query algorithm to find points within a specified distance (radius) of given query points in an N-dimensional space.

Input:

1. A list of input points in an N-dimensional space.
2. A reference point is chosen randomly from the combined list of input and query points.
3. A radius value indicates the maximum distance to consider points as neighbors.

Output:

The output consists of the neighbors of each query point within the specified radius. Each query point's neighbors are listed in the result file, showing which other points from the input list are within the specified radius of that particular query point.
